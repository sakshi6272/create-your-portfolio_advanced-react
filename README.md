# create-your-portfolio_advanced-react
Create your portfolio project from Coursera(Meta) for advanced react course

Task
In this final lab, you are going to create a portfolio page for yourself. You will be using the skills you have learned in this course to create a page that showcases your work. The portfolio page will be a single page that will contain the following sections:

A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page

A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio

A section to display your featured projects as cards in a grid fashion

A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to contact you

Here you will have the opportunity to use some popular open source libraries that will help you to have a more polished and professional looking page.

Before proceeding further, let's provide an introduction to the libraries you will be using.
